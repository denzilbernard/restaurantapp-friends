Ollei	https://maps.app.goo.gl/5HMYExhEcpbCQvyL9?g_st=ipc	San Francisco	Russian Hill	Korean 	Food is absolutely fantastic	Kimchi Fried Rice 	Walk-in only/no reservations	Sometimes they have a wait 
Pizzaiolo	https://www.pizzaiolooakland.com	Oakland	Temescal	Californian/Italian	Rotating menus that highlight the best of the current season. Don't go just for pizza - the salads, pastas, entrees, and especially dessers are where Pizzaiolo truly shines. Almost everything is cooked in their wood-fired pizza oven (hence the name, which in Italian means "in the style of pizza"). Their breakfast offerings are also remarkable!	The menu changes frequently so nothing is guaranteed, but I've had no bad dishes here. Some particular highlights include their meatballs, fried chicken, persimmon and fennel salad, pork coppa, pepperoni and jalapeño pizza, and ricotta donuts (particularly with their housemade almond and fig gelato during the summertime). For breakfast, I recommend the savory porridge or biscuits and gravy.	Walk-in only/no reservations	All tables are walk-in only but check their website beforehand because they sometimes take limited reservations for holidays or will be closed to host weddings or other private events. In the summer, patio seating fills up quickly after opening.
